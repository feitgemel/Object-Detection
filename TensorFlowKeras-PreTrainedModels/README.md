Discover how to classify objects using pre-trained models
<br/><br/> 
Welcome to our YouTube tutorial on Image Classification using Python, TensorFlow, and Keras with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). 

🎥 What's Covered in the Video:

- Building the classification pipeline with TensorFlow and Keras for seamless implementation.
Leveraging the Keras application library to load powerful pre-trained models like ResNet50 and MobileNet.

- Preparing your own fresh images for classification, ensuring they fit the model's requirements and converting them into batches using the Numpy expand_dims function.

- Running predictions on the pre-trained models for your input images to see them in action.
